## About this project

Tang Nano 9K-Invaders2 is a compact, arcade-style game inspired by the classic Space Invaders, rebuilt for an FPGA board in a modern, compact package. The game is designed to run on the Tang Nano 9K FPGA board, pairing a simple, tile-based display with crisp, responsive controls. The project emphasizes clear hardware design, readable code, and an approachable development path so hobbyists, students, and engineers can study, reuse, or remix the design.

The project is a follow-up to a prior Tang Nano project that demonstrated the core concept of a space shooter on a small FPGA. Invaders2 extends that idea with enhanced graphics, smoother animation, more enemies, progressive waves, and refined collision logic. The codebase is arranged to be approachable for readers who want to learn how a retro arcade game maps onto FPGA resources, including sprite rendering, background tiling, sprite collision detection, and sound generation.

The Tang Nano 9K is a compact FPGA board that provides enough logic resources to demonstrate a complete, playable game with a few moving parts, basic audio, and a clean video signal path. This project leverages Verilog for core logic and mentions VHDL in places where some collaborators might prefer it. The emphasis remains on portability, clarity, and a straightforward build process that players can replicate on their own hardware.

## Understanding the game design

Space Invaders Part II on Tang Nano 9K is a compact but complete arcade experience. The core ideas include:

- A player ship at the bottom of the screen
- A fleet of aliens moving in stepwise patterns
- Player bullets that travel upward and collide with aliens or shields
- Aliens that advance toward the bottom as the waves progress
- Simple scoring and a game-over condition when aliens reach the bottom or the player is hit
- Audio feedback for actions like movement, firing, hits, and explosions

The design focuses on deterministic timing. The frame rate remains stable across a variety of hardware configurations, ensuring predictable gameplay. The rendering path uses a tile-based approach to keep the geometry simple and robust for the FPGA’s resources. Sprite rendering is kept small and cost-effective, so the board can handle the core game logic without starving the video or audio paths.

In practice, you will see a small playfield with a few visible elements:
- The player ship at the bottom
- A grid of enemy invaders above
- Barriers or shields between the player and invaders
- A few projectiles flying across the screen

The game loop is broken into distinct phases: input capture, physics/update, rendering, and audio generation. Each phase runs in a predictable sequence to maintain the illusion of a smooth, real-time arcade game.

## How the code is organized

The repository uses a modular layout designed to help readers locate the major functional areas quickly. The primary folders and their purposes include:

- src/verilog: Core hardware description in Verilog. This contains the modules for the video pipeline, sprite rendering, collision logic, input handling, and the game state machine.
- src/vhdl (optional): Supplemental components implemented in VHDL for readers who prefer that language. Some teams mix Verilog and VHDL for educational purposes.
- docs: Design notes, timing diagrams, and references that explain the reasoning behind the architecture.
- tools: Scripts and helpers that assist with building, simulating, or packaging the design.
- assets: Optional resources such as sprite sheets, fonts, and tilesets used for illustration or future enhancements.
- tests: Test benches and simple co-simulation scripts to validate the game logic and timing.
- examples: Minimal demonstrations of specific features, such as a single sprite or a basic collision scenario.
- README.md: The central documentation file you are reading now.

The code is written to be readable and approachable. Each module has a clear purpose, a defined interface, and comments that explain design decisions. The goal is to make it easy to study how a retro-style game maps to FPGA resources and to reuse parts of the design in other projects.

## Verilog and VHDL components

- Video and timing
  - A simple video clock domain that drives a small display
  - A raster-like rendering pipeline tailored for a low-resolution, single-bit color path
  - Pixel-level rendering of a player ship, invaders, and shields
- Game logic
  - A finite state machine (FSM) that handles game states: start, playing, paused, and game over
  - Enemy movement logic that updates after a fixed number of frames
  - Bullet management with collision checks against invaders and shields
- Input handling
  - Debounced and edge-detected inputs for left/right movement and fire
  - Support for a keyboard-like or analog joystick depending on wiring
- Audio
  - A simple tone generator that plays separate beeps for events (move, shoot, hit)
  - A minimal, affordable sound route that works with a small speaker
- Memory and graphics
  - Tile-based background with a compact sprite engine
  - Collision detection paths that determine hits and misses
  - A small palette system and an optional color mode (monochrome by default for simplicity)

If you explore the Verilog, you will see how each subsystem communicates with the others via well-defined signals. The code emphasizes straightforward control flow and timing alignment, making it easier to understand how a retro game can fit into a constrained FPGA fabric.

## Graphics, sound, and user input

- Graphics
  - The display is driven by a tile-based rendering approach that composes the final image from small sprite blocks.
  - The player ship, invaders, shields, and basic explosions are drawn with simple pixel art suitable for a low-resolution, monochrome or limited-color output.
  - The game keeps a steady frame rate to ensure smooth motion of ships and bullets.

- Sound
  - Sound is generated with a basic digital oscillator that creates beeps for various actions.
  - The audio channel is intentionally lightweight but audible. It provides feedback without requiring a dedicated DAC or complex synthesis.

- Input
  - Left and right movement are captured from a two-key or joystick-like input. Fire is handled by a separate button or trigger.
  - Debouncing and edge detection ensure reliable control even when buttons are pressed rapidly.

The combination of these elements gives a satisfying retro experience while staying within the resource bounds of the Tang Nano 9K board.

---

## Timing, rendering, and performance

- Frame timing
  - The game targets a stable frame rate, with a predictable number of cycles per frame based on the board clock.
  - Movement and animation updates occur at a fixed frequency to maintain consistent gameplay.

- Rendering performance
  - The rendering path is designed to be light on resources, avoiding heavy texture or shading calculations.
  - A tile-and-sprite approach keeps pixel generation simple and efficient.

- Resource use
  - The design is optimized for the Tang Nano 9K’s logic cells and memory resources.
  - The module interfaces are kept minimal to reduce routing complexity and improve timing margins.

- Validation
  - The design includes simple test benches and a straightforward set of checks to verify correct operation under normal conditions.

This balance of timing, rendering, and resource usage is what makes the Tang Nano 9K version workable while still delivering a satisfying arcade experience.

  - A Linux or Windows environment that can run the toolchain
  - Basic scripting abilities to drive the build and packaging steps

- Steps
  - Inspect the src/verilog directory to understand the hardware modules
  - Open the project in Gowin Designer (or your toolchain)
  - Wire up the top-level module to your target board and clock
  - Compile, simulate, and generate the bitstream
  - Package the bitstream with any necessary loader utilities
  - Flash to Tang Nano 9K and test

- Simulation and verification
  - The test benches validate important timing and collision behavior
  - Simple golden tests confirm that the game state machine transitions as expected

- Extending the project
  - You can add new waves, alter sprite patterns, or experiment with different music tones
  - The modular design makes it feasible to reuse the video pipeline for other games

## What’s inside: code organization overview

- Top-level:
  - TangNano9K_Invaders2_top.v (or equivalent top module)
  - Clock and reset handling
  - Video output interface
  - Audio output interface
  - Game state machine
- Submodules:
  - video_renderer.v: Produces the final pixel stream
  - sprite_engine.v: Encodes positions and shapes of sprites
  - collision_checker.v: Detects bullet-vs-invader and bullet-vs-shield hits
  - input_handler.v: Debouncing and edge detection for controls
  - game_logic.v: Maintains score, waves, and level progression
  - sound_gen.v: Generates beeps and tones
- Supporting:
  - constants.vh: Shared constants for sprites, timings, and screen geometry
  - utils.vhd (optional): If you include VHDL counterparts
  - testbenches/: Basic tests for the main subsystems

The separation helps you see how each part contributes to the whole. It’s also straightforward to tweak individual components without rewiring the entire design.

## Customization options

- Display resolution and color mode
  - The design is adaptable to different display line rates and color depths. If you have a display with more color capability, you can adapt the color logic to use extra bits per pixel.
- Wave and difficulty tuning
  - The enemy movement interval and projectile speed are exposed as parameters. You can adjust these to change game speed or to introduce more challenging waves.
- Audio customization
  - The tone generator supports different frequencies and durations. You can modify the sequence to produce a richer soundscape while staying within a small hardware budget.
- Input devices
  - The input path is modular. You can swap in a joystick module, keyboard emulation, or touch-based controls if you want to prototype a different control scheme.
- Graphics assets
  - While the core engine uses standard sprite patterns, you can replace the tile and sprite images with your own pixel art. The layout accommodates changes with minimal risk of breaking the rendering pipeline.

These options let you tailor the game to your hardware and preferences, while preserving the core design philosophy: simplicity, reliability, and educational value.
